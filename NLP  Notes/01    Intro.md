# 🧠 Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## 📌 Why NLP?
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Enables chatbots, voice assistants (Siri, Alexa).
- **Information Extraction:** Analyzes large amounts of text (emails, reviews, articles).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Identifies whether a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- **Machine Translation:** Google Translate, real-time translation tools.

## 🏗 Key Building Blocks of NLP
1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization (splitting text into words/sentences)
   - Stopword Removal (removing common words like *is, the, and*)
   - Stemming & Lemmatization (reducing words to root form)
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
   - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

3. **Model Building**
   - Classical ML Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
   - Deep Learning Models: LSTM, GRU, Transformer-based models (BERT, GPT)

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
