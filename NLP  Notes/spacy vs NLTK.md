# NLP Libraries: spaCy vs NLTK

When working with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python, **spaCy** and **NLTK** are two of the most popular libraries. Hereâ€™s a quick comparison:

| Feature                     | **NLTK**                                       | **spaCy**                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Full Name**                 | Natural Language Toolkit                      | spaCy (no acronym)                        |
| **Ease of Use**               | Moderate, sometimes verbose                   | Very easy and intuitive                   |
| **Speed**                     | Slower, not optimized for large datasets     | Very fast, optimized for production      |
| **Preprocessing**             | Basic: tokenization, stopwords, stemming, POS tagging | Advanced: tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, NER |
| **Text Representation**       | Mostly Bag-of-Words, manual TF-IDF, word embeddings through other libraries | Supports word vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe) directly |
| **Use Case**                  | Good for learning NLP concepts, research     | Best for production-ready NLP applications |
| **Named Entity Recognition**  | Limited, requires manual rules or models     | Built-in high-accuracy NER                |
| **Community & Resources**     | Huge, but can be fragmented                   | Growing fast, modern documentation       |
| **Installation Size**         | Lightweight                                   | Slightly larger due to pre-trained models|

### **When to Use What**
- **NLTK**: Best for learning NLP fundamentals, research experiments, and educational purposes.
- **spaCy**: Best for production applications, large datasets, and tasks needing speed and accuracy (e.g., sentiment analysis, NER).

### **Example: Preprocessing Text**

**NLTK Example**
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

text = "I love programming in Python!"
words = word_tokenize(text.lower())
words = [w for w in words if w.isalpha() and w not in stopwords.words('english')]
ps = PorterStemmer()
words = [ps.stem(w) for w in words]
print(words)
